Bidding Strategies
    Target CPA (max Comversion at targeted CPA)
        With "Target CPA", Google Ads automatically sets bids to help get as many conversions as possible at the target cost-per-action (CPA) you set. Some conversions may cost more or less than your target.
    
    Target ROAS (max Comversion at targeted ROAS)
        With "Target ROAS", Google Ads automatically sets bids to help get as much conversion value as possible at the target return on ad spend(ROAS) you set. Some conversions may have a higher or lower return than your target.
    
    Maximum Clicks (max Clicks within Budget)
        With "Maximize clicks", Google Ads automatically sets your bids to help get as many clicks as possible within your budget. A maximum CPC bid limit caps each cost-per-click bid. This could limit the clicks on your ad.

    Maximum Coversion (max Comversion within Budget)
        Google Ads automatically sets your bids to help you get the most conversions within your budget.

    Maximum Coversion Value (max Comversion Value within Budget)
        Google Ads automatically sets your bids to help you get the most conversion value within your budget.

    Target Impression Share (increase Chances of showing ads)
        "Target impression share" automatically sets your bids to increase your ads' chances of appearing in the search page area you select.
