The Leh Palace, Shanti Stupa, and Hemis Monastery are just a few of the numerous historical sites that highlight Ladakh's cultural significance.</p>

                    <p>The traditional Ladakhi people live in harmony with their environment, practicing agriculture, livestock rearing, and artisan crafts.
