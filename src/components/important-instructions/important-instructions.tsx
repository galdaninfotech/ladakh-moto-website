            <h3>Pre-Tour Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Fitness Check:</strong>nsure you are physically fit and capable of riding long distances in high-altitude terrain. Consult your doctor if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Gear Up:</strong> Carry essential biking gear, including a certified helmet, riding jacket with armor, gloves, knee guards, and waterproof boots. Pack thermals, rain gear, and layers for varying weather conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Bike Condition:</strong> Inspect your bike (if bringing your own) thoroughly. Ensure brakes, tires, lights, and engine are in optimal condition.</li>
                <li><strong>Documents:</strong> Keep your driving license, vehicle registration, insurance, pollution control certificate, and any permits provided by Ladakhmoto handy.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Group Riding Guidelines</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Follow the Leader:</strong> Stay behind the road captain, who ensures route safety and navigation. Do not overtake without explicit permission.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain Formation:</strong> Stick to the assigned riding order (staggered or single file, as instructed). This ensures visibility and minimizes risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Safe Distance:</strong> Maintain a minimum distance of 10-15 meters from the bike ahead to allow reaction time.</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Use agreed-upon hand signals or intercoms to indicate hazards, stops, or issues. Avoid sudden braking or swerving.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>On the Road</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Speed Limit:</strong> Adhere to the speed limits decided by the group leader based on road and weather conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Checkpoints:</strong> Stop only at designated checkpoints or as instructed. This ensures no one gets separated.</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel Stops:</strong> Refuel at every opportunity. Fuel stations are sparse in the Himalayas.</li>
                <li><strong>Alertness:</strong> Watch out for loose gravel, water crossings, landslides, and wildlife. Slow down on blind curves.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Night Riding:</strong> ride after sundown unless absolutely necessary, as Himalayan roads can be treacherous in low visibility.</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acclimatization:</strong> Follow the acclimatization schedule planned by Ladakhmoto to prevent altitude sickness. Avoid rushing to high passes.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated but avoid alcohol and smoking, as they can exacerbate altitude issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Recognize Symptoms:</strong> Inform the road captain immediately if you experience dizziness, nausea, headache, or breathlessness. Emergency oxygen and support will be provided.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Responsibility Towards the Environment</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>No Littering:</strong> Dispose of waste responsibly. Use the garbage bags provided or carry trash to designated disposal points.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect Nature:</strong> Avoid disturbing wildlife or damaging local flora. Do not honk unnecessarily.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Locals:</strong> Respect local customs and communities, and purchase responsibly to support their livelihoods.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Emergency Protocols</h3>

                <li><strong>Breakdowns:</strong> If your bike has a mechanical issue, inform the mechanic or road captain immediately. The support vehicle will assist you.</li>
