            </p>

            <h3>Pre-Tour Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Fitness Check:</strong>Kindly be sure to check up with your doctor if you are fit enough to undertake long-distance motorbike riding in high altitudes.</li>
                <li><strong>Gear Up:</strong> Donâ€™t forget to only carry vital biking equipment which include boots designed for wet conditions, thermals, raincoats, and other forms of clothing for dynamic weather scenarios. An approved helmet, armored riding jackets, gloves, knee guards will be provided by Us.</li>
                <li><strong>Bike Condition:</strong> In case you prefer to use your own bike, conduct detailed checks on systems such as brakes, tires, lights, and the engine for optimal conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Documents:</strong> Retain your driving license, motorcycle registration, certified insurance, pollution control cert. and permits given by Ladakhmoto on hand.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Group Riding Guidelines</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Follow the Leader:</strong> Position yourself behind the road captain who takes charge of safety and direction. Overtaking is prohibited unless specified and allowed with a warning.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain Formation:</strong> Always follow the given riding order (staggered or single file, as given). This makes it easier for the riders to see and feel safer.</li>
                <li><strong>Safe Distance:</strong> Start by keeping a distance of at least 10 to 15 meters from the bike in front of you to create a safe reaction time.</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Use the predetermined hand signals or intercoms to inform danger, stop omissions, or even problems. Try not to brake suddenly or make any sharp turns.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>On the Road</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Speed Limit:</strong> Follow the speed limits that the main group member set according to the conditions on the road and the weather.</li>
                <li><strong>Checkpoints:</strong> The only reason to stop at points other than the designated ones is if someone weakens from riding the motorbike. This ensures no one gets lost.</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel Stops:</strong> You will be guided to proper refueling points during the tour as the fuel cost is included in the package price.</li>
                <li><strong>Alertness:</strong> Beware of loose gravel, water, landslides, and animals on the road during animal crossings. Use lower gears when going around blind curves.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Night Riding:</strong> Where possible, refrain from riding after the sunlight goes down, as driving along poorly lit Himalayan roads can be dangerous. This applies to other shifts if at all.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Altitude and Health</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acclimatization:</strong> Follow the acclimatization schedule planned by Ladakhmoto to prevent altitude sickness. Avoid rushing to high passes.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated but avoid alcohol and smoking, as they can exacerbate altitude issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Recognize Symptoms:</strong> Inform the road captain immediately if you experience dizziness, nausea, headache, or breathlessness. Emergency oxygen and support will be provided.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Responsibility Towards the Environment</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>No Littering:</strong> Dispose of waste responsibly. Use the garbage bags provided or carry trash to designated disposal points.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect Nature:</strong> Avoid disturbing wildlife or damaging local flora. Do not honk unnecessarily.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Locals:</strong> Respect local customs and communities, and purchase responsibly to support their livelihoods.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Emergency Protocols</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Breakdowns:</strong> Always reach out to your mechanic or the road captain in the event of a mechanical failure. The support team will take care of you.</li>
                <li><strong>Backup:</strong> In the event that you find yourself in an area with limited communication, always remain within the range of the group.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>General Etiquette</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Punctuality:</strong> In all aspects, do not be late for departure, meals, and especially briefings. Delays affect the entire group.</li>
                <li><strong>Positive Attitude:</strong> Get along with the team and other riders in the group in order to sustain balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Overpacking:</strong> Ladakhmoto has certain limits in terms of luggage and gear which should never be exceeded. Too much baggage will only cause the team to waste time and confuse the logistics.</li>
            </ol>
